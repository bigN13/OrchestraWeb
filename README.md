Introduction to Orchestra
-------------------------

Orchestra is a composable shell that allows developers to skip the
process of writing a custom framework for every application they have to
write. This way it is possible to focus on the actual business problem
that needs to be solved instead of writing a framework again and again.

The biggest advantage is that the core is maintained by open-source
developers so you will get improvements and new features by simply
updating to a new version.
